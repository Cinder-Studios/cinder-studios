      We together work on many projects. Most of them aren't full scale projects like the ones
      you'll see listed on our website. We advertise the projects that are much larger, taking
      usually months to complete if not just start. We hope to on these large projects, gain
      more people who would want to join us in out edeavors. We're open to pretty much anyone
      who would like to help us out. Under the contact us section, you can join our discord and

        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>
          As already stated, there are two of us that work in Cinder Studios right now. I'm Brad,
          at least the one who's typing this. Most of what you're seeing has been my work, and that
          starts off with what separates me and Argo. I do a lot of problem solving. I don't do things
          if it doesn't solve a problem. We needed a website, so I'm doing a lot of this. Argo will type
          up his own bio, but you get the gist. Welcome to ussr, and we're always open for more people to
          join the team. This is our start, but by far it is not our end. This studio is open for anything
          , so challenge us, and we'll do our best. If our best isn't good enough, we'll get better.

          I don't have a lot to say, look at the spreadsheets. Also skarm is a thing, try poking him.

        How To
      </h1>
      <p>
         For projects like ours, we need ideas and more people to join us. To get in
         touch, use one of our contact links. For any buisness inquiries, please use
         our studio email and not anything else. If you want to join us, talk to us,
         or get in touch for any other reasons, our discord server is the best way to
         do that. We use that server not only as a basis for a support group, but also
         to organize our thoughts, tests bots, get in touch with other people to talk to,
         and even expand our group here in the studios.
       </p>

       <p>
         When you join the discord server, you will have one chance to set your name.
         Please be sure to make this name something you will respond to, is appropriate,
         and doesn't violate any of the rules of the server. If it is innappropriate or
         offensive, we will tempban you from the server until you give us a different name
         to set you to. If this happens more than once, while as a buisness partner you
         won't be disrespected, you'll no longer be allowed in the discord server, limited
         to only email contact for buisness reasons only.
       </p>
